# Ecommerce Application - Project Overview

## Description
Our ecommerce application is designed to provide users with a seamless shopping experience by utilizing a single-page architecture with Ajax integration. This approach eliminates the need for frequent page reloads, resulting in a smoother and faster user interface.

## Key Features
1. **Single-Page Design**: The ecommerce application is built as a single-page application (SPA), allowing users to navigate and interact with different sections of the application without experiencing unnecessary page reloads.
2. **Ajax Integration**: Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is incorporated to handle dynamic data retrieval and updating of specific sections within the application without requiring a full page reload, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.
3. **Product Search**: Users can search for products based on keywords, category, or brand, with search results dynamically loaded and displayed on the same page.
4. **Wishlist and Cart**: Registered users can add products to their wishlist and cart, with updates reflected instantly on the page without the need for a page refresh.
5. **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and perform authentication actions seamlessly within the single-page application.
6. **Product Filtering**: Users can dynamically filter and sort search results based on various criteria such as price range, top brands, and other relevant attributes.
7. **Real-time Product Availability**: The application ensures that out-of-stock products are promptly updated and removed from the displayed options, preventing users from selecting or adding them to their cart.
8. **Order Placement and Management**: Users can place orders, provide shipping and payment details, and manage their orders within the single-page application, with instant updates reflecting any changes made.
9. **Review System**: Users who have placed orders can add reviews for specific products, with the review submission and display handled seamlessly within the single-page application.

## Restrictions
1. Anonymous User Limitations: Users who are not logged in can only search for products and view reviews, but cannot add items to their cart or wishlist until they create an account and log in.
2. Order Quantity Limit: To prevent abuse, there is a restriction on the number of products a user can purchase in a single order, ensuring fair and controlled purchasing practices.

## Technologies Used
1. **Java**: Backend development and business logic.
2. **MySQL**: Database management for storing and retrieving data.
3. **HTML**: Structure and layout of web pages.
4. **CSS**: Styling and visual presentation.
5. **JavaScript (Ajax)**: Enhancing interactivity and enabling asynchronous data retrieval.
6. **Servlet**: Handling HTTP requests and responses.

These technologies form the core components of our full-stack ecommerce application, enabling dynamic user interfaces, efficient data management, and seamless user interactions.
